# Supabase Data Parsing Functions for TMDB and Eneyida.tv

This repository contains functions for parsing and handling data from TMDB and Eneyida.tv resources, using Supabase as the database service.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **src**: This directory contains test versions of our data parsing functions. These functions are subject to changes and refinements before becoming part of the main functionality.
  
- **supabase/functions**: This directory contains the approved and currently used functions for data parsing and handling. Changes in this directory have direct effects on our data handling procedures.
